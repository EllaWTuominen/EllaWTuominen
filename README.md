# 👋 Hi all, I’m @EllaWTuominen

I'm a PhD student at UCL, doing the 4-year Wellcome Trust PhD in Mental Health Science. 
I'm based at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and my research looks at avoidance 
as a symptom of anxiety and the cognitive mechanisms of psychotherapy modalities used in 
the treatment of anxious avoidance. 

Interested in  
✨psychotherapy modalities  
✨psychopharmacology  
✨mental health apps  
✨psychedelics  
✨behaviour change  
✨neuroscience  
✨mindfulness  

🌱 I’m currently learning more about computational modeling on a research exchange at the Niv Lab at Princeton University. 
🤝 I’m open to collaborations.
